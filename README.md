# Spam-Ham-Classifier
<h1>Email Classifier</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I trained a logistic regression model using numpy, Sci-kit learn, and Pandas libraries to solve whether an email is spam or ham. I also utilized EDA, feature engineering, and a data pipeline to classify emails with an 88% accuracy. Defined HOFs like words_in_text to indicate whether a word occurs in the email dataset at least once. Used seaborn to visualize the distribution of spam/ham words in emails and the correlation between words to avoid multicollinearity. Used performance metrics like ROC, accuracy, and recall to evaluate model performance.
