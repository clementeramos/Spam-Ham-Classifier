    "## Introduction\n",
    "You will use what you've learned in class to create a binary classifier that can distinguish spam (junk, commercial, or bulk) emails from ham (regular non-spam) emails. In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this project, you should feel comfortable with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature engineering with text data.\n",
    "- Using the `sklearn` library to process data and fit models.\n",
    "- Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first part of the project focuses on initial analysis, feature engineering, and logistic regression. In the second part of this project (which will be released next week), you will build your own spam/ham classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content Warning\n",
    "This is a **real-world** dataset —— the emails you are trying to classify are actual spam and legitimate emails. As a result, some of the spam emails may be in poor taste or be considered inappropriate. We think the benefit of working with realistic data outweighs these inappropriate emails but wanted to provide a warning at the beginning of the project so that you are aware.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you feel uncomfortable with this topic, **please contact your TA, the instructors, or reach out via the [Spring 2024 extenuating circumstances form](https://forms.gle/HFdpmHzBu1e7zcF2A).**"

We, therefore, need to split the training data into separate training and validation datasets. You will need this **validation data** to assess the performance of your classifier once you are finished training. Note that we set the seed (`random_state`) to 42.

Otherwise, if the $j$-th word is not present in the $i$-th email, the value at $(i, j)$ should be 0.\n",

In future parts of this analysis, we will make use of the data we held out for model validation and comparison.\n",

    "- **False negative (FN)**: A spam email gets mislabeled as ham and ends up in the inbox.\n",

    "To be clear, we label spam emails as 1 and ham emails as 0. These definitions depend both on the true labels and the predicted labels.

    "I would prefer to use my_model because although it does not have a super high accuracy, it has a relatively higher precision of 0.64 -- which gives us a better understanding of model performance, rather than just looking at the accuracy. It does, however, have a very low recall as expected since there is an inverse relationship between recall and precision. And in this case for our regression model to correctly classify spam emails as spam, precision gives us more relevant information about the proportion of emails classified as spam that were truly spam. On the other hand, a zero prediction model would not have high precision of spam classification since it does not filter for spam email at all. This is not a good model."
